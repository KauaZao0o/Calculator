# Project Objective ðŸŽ¯
Develop a functional and responsive calculator with an intuitive interface and additional features such as percentage calculation, factorial, inverse operations, and history management. The goal is to explore different technologies and frameworks for implementing both the graphical interface and mathematical logic.

# Key Features ðŸ› 
<ul>
  <li>Responsive Graphical Interface: The calculator adapts to different screen sizes, dynamically adjusting the font size of numbers and buttons.</li>
  <li>Advanced Operations: Supports functions like exponentiation, square root, factorial, and percentage calculations.</li>
  <li>"âŒ«" Key: Allows deleting a single digit at a time, improving usability.</li>
  <li>Adaptive Mode: Automatically adjusts font size as the screen expands or shrinks.</li>
  <li>Calculation History: Stores previous operations for reference.</li>
</ul>

# Tech Stack ðŸ’»
<ul>
  <li><b>Python (Tkinter):</b> For a lightweight and efficient graphical user interface.</li>
  <li><b>Java (Swing):</b> For a more structured and robust approach to desktop applications.</li>
  <li><b>PHP:</b> For a web-based implementation, enabling server-side calculations and storage of user history.</li>
  <li><b>Other Languages (planned):</b> Expanding the project to other technologies such as JavaScript (Electron.js), C# (WinForms/WPF), or even mobile versions with React Native or Kotlin.</li>
</ul>


  <i>This project aims to explore different programming languages and frameworks to understand their strengths and weaknesses in developing interactive graphical applications.</i>
